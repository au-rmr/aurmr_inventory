## How to get the project onto local machine and run the app?

1. First, clone the repository onto your preferred folder inside your local machine. 
2. Then, `cd` into the repository folder on your local machine. 
3. If you wish to create a branch and work inside that branch, make sure you perform `git checkout -b "<your-branch-name>"`. This is to create a new branch. You can then perform `git status` to check if your branch was created successfully. 
4. Now, perform `yarn install`. This is to make sure all the `yarn` packages are installed into your local project. 
5. Then, change directory into `server`, which you can do by running `cd server`. 
6. Now, perform `yarn install` again inside the `server` folder to make sure to install necessary modules inside this folder. 
7. This should set-up your project on the local machine. You can now change directory by going back one level. You can do this by performing `cd ..`. Then, you should be able to run `yarn start` and a reactapp should get started on your web browser. 

## How to start graphql playground? 
For Your Information: graphql playground is something that runs on `localhost:4000` that provides a space for you to write and test out queries and mutations before making it official and adding it to your app. It also provides you a nice UI that prompts you suggestions when writing your queries and mutations. To get this working, please follow the steps below.

1. First, perform `cd server` so that you are in your `server` folder.
2. Then, perform `npx prisma generate`
3. Finally, perform `node src/index.js`

## Important things to keep in mind:
1. You should stop, run `npx prisma generate`, and then re-run `node src/index.js` after any edit within your `server` folder. Then refresh your playground to see changes. 
2. If you make any edits to `schema.prisma`, it is important to run `prisma migrate dev --name <give-your-migration-a-name>`. This is because you made some edits to your database and you want those changes to be reflected. 
3. The column names of models that you define in your schema must be exactly same as the models you define in your `graphql.schema`. In other words, the column names that you have for your prisma table needs to be exactly the same as the column names that you give to your graphql schema. 
4. *Extra (high-level) information about how the server side of things are working*: graphql serves to provide a "front-end" experience, which means this is what you use in the reactapp to query and get information from. graphql then contacts prisma through a mode called `resolvers.js`, which then contacts the database to obtain the data.
